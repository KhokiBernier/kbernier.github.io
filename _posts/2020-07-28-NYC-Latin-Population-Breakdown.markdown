# Project Overview
Visualize and detail NYC Latin/Hispanic Neighborhood population by nationality.

# Motivation
- A lof of latin/hispanics immigrate to New York City and not all are able to speak English. Living in a neighborhood with people from your country can help with the transition and assimilation into a new country while also making you feel at home. 
- I've always considered moving to New York City and would like to live in a Spanish speaking area
- Cultures between Spanish speaking countries can differ vastly, so breaking down latin/hispanic into nationality is more helpful

# Libraries Used:
