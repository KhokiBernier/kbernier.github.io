The Human Freedom Index attempts to measure the freedom people have within each country on a standardized scale from 1-10. The Human Freedom score is derived from 2 key metrics - Personal Freedom and Economic Freedom - and is the average of both these scores. 

Human Freedom =  (Personal Freedom + Economic Freedom) / 2

Both Personal Freedom and Economic Freedom are comprised of many factors, some of which are listed in the visualization.
