Built NBA Team dashboards with 15 years of trends around key statistics that impact win % filterable by team and year. 
- The big green or red numbers next to each metric indicate the team value 
- The smaller number to it's bottom right is the difference from the league average
  - If the number is red, the team is below league average
  - If the number is green, the team is above league average
